# Quantitative-Macroeconomics

Python Code for my advances Quantitative Macroeconomics class in the University of Toronto. 

Focus of the class was on implementation of state-of-the-art heterogeneous agent macroeconomic models, which relaxed a common assumption of representative agent. Without this assumption many models do not have an analytical solution and as a result quantitative techniques from control theory and physics become useful.
